        <p>My name is Khatia, 22, still a student, looking for a part time job I can do while still at school, ideally working remotely. Iâ€™m skilled with PHP and Java, and I am trying to learn other programming languages, step by step. I try to get the most out of my time at the college, and have some edge once I graduate, which is the primary reason why I seek a part time job with you.</p>
